This will involve user authentication, data retrieval, and potentially data synchronization between your app and these services.\n2.  **Camera Access for Progress Photos:**\n    *   The app needs permission to access the device's camera to take progress photos. You'll need to use a library like `react-native-camera` or `expo-image-picker` to handle camera access and image capture.
